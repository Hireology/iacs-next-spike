# Next + Preact Spike

1. Clone this repository: `git clone git@github.com:Hireology/iacs-next-spike.git`
2. Navigate to the project: `cd /iacs-next-spike`
3. Install packagages: `npm i`
4. Start server: `npm run dev`
5. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/anytimefitnessstaugustinefl`

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file (disabled for Preact).

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/organization](http://localhost:3000/api/organization). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/organization.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
